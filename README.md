# BikesharingBoombike
A bike-sharing system provides bikes for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis, typically for a fee or even free of charge. These systems often feature "docks," computer-controlled stations where users can input their payment information to unlock a bike. After use, the bike can be returned to any dock within the same system.

## Overview
BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the United States, has faced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is grappling with the challenges of sustaining its business in the current market conditions. To prepare for a resurgence in demand once the lockdowns end and the economy recovers, BoomBikes is developing a strategic business plan.
